# Image Classification Projects with Deep Learning

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks demonstrating various image classification tasks using deep learning and machine learning techniques. Each notebook focuses on a different dataset or model architecture, showcasing approaches to solving image recognition challenges.

## Overview

The notebooks included in this repository cover a range of image classification problems:

- **CIFAR10.ipynb**: Implements deep learning models for classifying images from the CIFAR-10 dataset, a widely used benchmark for image recognition.
- **ConvNet.ipynb**: Demonstrates the construction and training of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for general image classification tasks.
- **Fashion_Recognition_Model.ipynb**: Focuses on classifying fashion items (such as clothing) using a deep learning model, typically leveraging the Fashion MNIST dataset.
- **HandDigitsRecognition.ipynb**: Provides an implementation of a model for recognizing handwritten digits (e.g., using the MNIST dataset).
- **ImageClassification_ML.ipynb**: Explores image classification using traditional machine learning approaches, complementing the deep learning models with alternative techniques.
